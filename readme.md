## Project Overview

The Bellagio Casino Backend project is designed to handle the core game logic, user management, and data storage for the casino platform. Built with Node.js and TypeScript, it ensures high performance and maintainability. The backend interacts with a frontend React application, providing APIs for game operations and user interactions.

### Development Practices

- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety, reducing runtime errors and improving code maintainability.
- **Sequelize ORM**: Manages database interactions with an object-relational mapping (ORM) approach, simplifying complex SQL queries and ensuring consistency.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions automate the testing and deployment process, ensuring reliable and quick updates. The backend is deployed on Heroku for scalable and easy-to-manage hosting.
- **RDS Database**: Uses Amazon RDS for reliable and scalable database management.
- **Joi**: Implements data validation to ensure the integrity of user inputs and API requests.

### Features

- **API for Game Logic**: Handles game operations like starting a new session, spinning the slot machine, and cashing out.
- **User Management**: Manages user sessions and credits.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores game sessions and user data securely in a relational database.

## Tech Stack

The Bellagio Casino Backend leverages a modern tech stack to ensure a high-quality user experience and efficient development process. The primary technologies used are:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, ensuring high performance for server-side applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. TypeScript enhances code quality by providing type safety, reducing runtime errors, and improving maintainability.
- **Sequelize ORM**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js. Sequelize provides easy-to-use syntax for interacting with relational databases, abstracting complex SQL queries and improving code readability.
- **Amazon RDS**: A scalable and reliable relational database service. RDS ensures high availability and performance for the application's data storage needs.
- **Joi**: A powerful schema description language and data validator for JavaScript. Joi is used to validate API requests, ensuring data integrity and preventing invalid inputs.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines to automate the build and deployment process.
- **Heroku**: A cloud platform that simplifies the deployment and scaling of the application.

## Considerations

### Code Structure and Maintainability

#### Reusable Functions and Middleware
Our application leverages reusable functions and middleware to handle various functionalities. This approach enhances maintainability and scalability, as functions and middleware can be independently developed, tested, and reused across different parts of the application.

#### TypeScript Integration
TypeScript is used throughout the project to provide static typing. This helps catch errors early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors. TypeScript's strong typing system improves code readability and makes it easier for developers to understand the data flow within the application.

### Sequelize ORM

#### Database Abstraction
Sequelize ORM abstracts the complexities of SQL queries, allowing developers to interact with the database using JavaScript objects. This improves code readability and maintainability, making it easier to manage database interactions.

#### Schema Management
Sequelize handles schema migrations and ensures that the database schema is always in sync with the application models. This reduces the risk of inconsistencies and makes it easier to manage database changes over time.

### Validation with Joi

#### Data Validation
Joi is used for validating incoming API requests, ensuring that all data conforms to the expected schema. This helps prevent invalid data from entering the system and improves the overall reliability of the application.

### CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions
We have implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that every change is thoroughly tested before being deployed to production. GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly with our repository, providing a streamlined workflow for developers.

#### Heroku Deployment
Heroku is used for deploying and hosting the backend application. Its ease of use and scalability make it an ideal choice for managing the application's deployment process. The integration with GitHub Actions ensures that new changes are automatically deployed to Heroku, providing a seamless and reliable deployment process.

## Future Tasks

### User Management
Implementing comprehensive user management features is a high priority. This includes:

- **User Registration and Login**: Allowing users to create accounts and log in securely.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implementing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data and ensure that only authorized users can access certain features.
- **User Profiles**: Enabling users to view and manage their profiles, including personal information and game history.

### Log Management
To improve monitoring and debugging, we plan to integrate a log management system. This will help us:

- **Track User Activities**: Monitoring user activities to gain insights into user behavior and improve the user experience.
- **Error Tracking**: Capturing and analyzing errors in real-time to quickly identify and resolve issues.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Keeping an eye on the performance metrics to ensure the application runs smoothly.

### Better Error Handling
Enhancing error handling mechanisms is essential for providing a smooth user experience. Future improvements include:

- **Centralized Error Handling**: Implementing a centralized error handling system to manage errors consistently across the application.
- **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Displaying clear and helpful error messages to users, guiding them on how to resolve issues or seek support.
- **Error Reporting**: Integrating tools for real-time error reporting and alerting to proactively address issues as they arise.

### Improved Design
We aim to continually improve the application's infrastructure to enhance performance and user satisfaction:

- **Caching**: Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce response times and improve the overall performance of the application.
- **Advanced Technologies**: Considering the use of advanced technologies such as AWS Lambda for serverless computing, message queues for handling asynchronous tasks, and Pub/Sub for real-time updates.

### Login/Logout Functionality
Implementing a secure login/logout functionality is crucial for managing user sessions:

- **Session Management**: Ensuring that user sessions are handled securely and efficiently.
- **Remember Me Feature**: Allowing users to stay logged in across sessions for convenience.
- **Logout Options**: Providing users with the ability to log out from all devices or sessions.

### User Profile for History Data
Adding a user profile section to display historical data will enhance the user experience:

- **Game History**: Allowing users to view their game history, including past games, scores, and achievements.
- **Account Settings**: Enabling users to manage their account settings, such as updating personal information and changing passwords.
- **Performance Stats**: Providing users with insights into their gaming performance and trends over time.

### Cron Job for BI
Implementing cron jobs for Business Intelligence (BI) will enable us to:

- **Automate Data Collection**: Regularly collect data on user behavior and game statistics.
- **Generate Reports**: Automatically generate reports on key performance indicators (KPIs).
- **Data Analysis**: Facilitate data analysis for better decision-making and strategic planning.

By addressing these future tasks, we aim to continually enhance the Bellagio Casino Backend, providing users with a feature-rich, secure, and enjoyable gaming experience.
